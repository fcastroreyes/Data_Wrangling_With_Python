# Python Data Wrangling Notebooks

## Overview
This GitHub repository showcases advanced data wrangling techniques through two Jupyter notebooks: PA_wrangle.ipynb and Titanic_Wrangling.ipynb. These notebooks are designed to provide both a comprehensive guide and practical examples of cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data using Python, making them valuable resources for learners and experienced data practitioners alike.

## Notebooks Description
- PA_wrangle.ipynb: Focuses on general data wrangling skills, demonstrating various techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- Titanic_Wrangling.ipynb: Offers a case study on the Titanic dataset, highlighting specific data wrangling tasks including handling missing values, feature engineering, and preparing data for machine learning models.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
- Data Transformation: Normalization, scaling, and categorical variable encoding.
- Data Exploration: Using statistics and visualizations to explore data distributions and relationships.
- Specialized Techniques: Time series analysis, text data preprocessing, and feature engineering.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
